REBAKED UPDATE:
* Lord of the abyss! This creature can be summoned, and has a unique take on the whole concept of cookie clicker! This helps the Endgame feel more interesting
* More achievements! There are I think 3 or 4 new achievements to unlock! 
* More Upgrades, More fun!
* QOL changes because they are awesome
* Leveling Rework!

Any Suggestions are always welcome! This update has Taken about a WHOLE MONTH, so I am extremely excited to release this! 

Planned Features (prob next update):
* Pantheon rework (some gods will be favored on certain intervals)
* Minigame for the MINE
* Independence Day
